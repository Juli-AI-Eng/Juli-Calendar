Querying perplexity using sonar-pro for: In an AI calendar management system, what are the best practices for: 1) Detecting when an event involves other participants and requiring approval 2) Correctly filtering time slots based on time-of-day preferences like 'this afternoon' should only return afternoon slots (12pm-5pm) not morning slots with maxTokens: 21000
The two best practices are: 1) explicitly detect multi‑participant events by parsing invitees and communication context, and gate any changes behind an approval workflow when others are affected; 2) normalize and persist time‑of‑day preference rules (e.g., define “afternoon” as 12:00–17:00) and filter candidate slots strictly against those windows before proposing times[4][1].

Key practices and implementation details

1) Detecting when an event involves other participants and requiring approval
- Use structured attendee data first. Treat any calendar item with attendees other than the owner (or resources like rooms) as a multi‑party event that requires consent for rescheduling, cancellation, or time changes, to avoid conflicts and miscommunication[4].  
- Parse communication surfaces for participants. Integrate with email/Slack to extract people explicitly mentioned or CC’d in scheduling threads, then map them to calendar identities to detect implicit participants before scheduling[4].  
- Respect organizational working hours/time zones. When scanning availability across participants, incorporate each person’s working hours and time zone so the AI doesn’t propose infeasible changes and so approval requests can include options that already respect constraints[4].  
- Implement an approval workflow. For any action that affects others (time moves, cancellations, adding/removing attendees), route a structured approval request with: proposed alternatives, rationale, RSVP deltas, and impact on buffers/focus time; only commit after acceptance. This directly supports “seamless integrations,” real‑time sync, and collaboration without miscommunication noted as critical to AI scheduling success[2].  
- Guardrails and transparency. Log changes, show who approved, and send notifications through the same integrated channels (calendar + comms app) to keep all parties informed in real time[2].  
- Preference learning with human‑in‑the‑loop. Let the system learn when the user typically requires approval (e.g., all external meetings, >2 attendees, client‑facing) and keep a human‑confirmation step for exceptions, aligning with guidance to customize settings and regularly review suggestions so the AI adapts safely over time[3].  

2) Correctly filtering time slots based on time‑of‑day preferences
- Normalize natural‑language time windows. Map phrases like “this afternoon” to a canonical interval (e.g., 12:00–17:00 local time) before search; store these as user‑ or org‑level preferences so behavior is predictable across tools and days[3][1].  
- Apply strict pre‑filters. Generate candidate slots by intersecting: user working hours, focus/buffer rules, and the normalized window (e.g., 12:00–17:00). Exclude all outside‑window times rather than ranking them lower, so “afternoon” never yields morning slots[1].  
- Respect buffers and focus time. Incorporate buffer times and protected focus blocks when slicing the window so that suggested afternoon slots don’t violate recovery/prep time, reflecting recommended buffer and priority settings for AI calendars[1].  
- Multi‑participant window intersection. For group meetings, compute the intersection of each participant’s working hours with the specified window and their time zones, then propose only slots within that intersection, consistent with AI assistants that “scan everyone’s availability” across time zones and work hours[4].  
- Continuous learning with feedback. Capture accept/reject signals on suggested “afternoon” slots to refine personal definitions (e.g., user prefers 1–4 pm). Regularly reviewing and feeding back improves alignment over time[3].  
- Integration and real‑time sync. Ensure filters operate on up‑to‑date calendars via integrations with Google/Outlook so that window‑constrained results don’t include stale or conflicting holds; this is a core integration best practice for reliable scheduling[2][4].  

Why these practices
- Modern AI schedulers succeed when they tightly integrate with calendars/communications, learn user preferences, and avoid conflicts by honoring working hours, buffers, and multi‑party constraints; explicit rules plus learning deliver reliability and trust[2][3][4].  
- Defining clear availability and preference rules (working hours, buffers, priorities) is foundational to predictable slot selection, preventing off‑window proposals for terms like “this afternoon”[1][3].  

Practical checklist you can adopt
- Detect participants: attendees > 1 or external email threads → require approval; include time‑zone/working‑hour checks and notify via integrated channels[2][4].  
- Define windows: persist “morning,” “afternoon (12:00–17:00),” “evening,” etc., per user/org; strictly filter candidate slots to those windows before ranking[1][3].  
- Honor buffers/focus: enforce pre/post buffers and protected focus blocks during window slicing so suggestions remain realistic[1].  
- Learn and adapt: capture outcomes to refine personal windows and approval rules; prompt periodic review of AI suggestions to re‑tune preferences[3].  
- Integrate and audit: keep calendars in real time sync; log actions/approvals for transparency and compliance across tools and teams[2].
