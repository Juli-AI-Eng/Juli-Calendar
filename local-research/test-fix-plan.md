Executing plan command with query: I have two failing e2e tests. First test expects a note about working hours when checking availability at 10pm but system doesn't provide one. Second test expects both tasks and events when querying 'What's on my calendar today' but only returns events (1 event, 0 tasks) even though there's a Reclaim task. Need to fix both issues.Using file provider: gemini

--- Implementation Plan ---
This document outlines a detailed implementation plan to resolve two failing end-to-end tests. The first issue involves a missing note about working hours when checking availability late at night. The second issue is a failure to return tasks scheduled for "today" when querying the calendar.

We will address these issues in two separate phases.

### Phase 1: Add Working Hours Note to Availability Check

**Goal:** The `test_working_hours_consideration` test fails because when checking availability at 10 PM, the system correctly reports the time as available but fails to add an expected note that this is outside of typical working hours. We will modify the `check_availability` tool to include this note.

**Relevant Files:**
*   `src/tools/check_availability.py`: To be modified.
*   `src/ai/calendar_intelligence.py`: Contains the helper function `is_working_hours`.
*   `tests/e2e/test_check_availability_e2e.py`: To verify the fix.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

1.  **Modify `_check_specific_time` in `check_availability.py`**

    Open `src/tools/check_availability.py` and navigate to the `_check_specific_time` method. The current implementation generates a simple availability message. We will enhance this message.

2.  **Import `CalendarIntelligence`**

    Add the necessary import at the top of the file, if it's not already there.
    ```python
    # src/tools/check_availability.py
    
    from src.ai.calendar_intelligence import CalendarIntelligence
    ```
    This may already be indirectly available, but an explicit import is cleaner. Based on the file contents, it is not there, so we'll need to add it near the other imports from `src.ai`.

    ```python
    # src/tools/check_availability.py
    
    # ... other imports
    from src.ai.availability_checker import AvailabilityChecker
    from src.ai.calendar_intelligence import CalendarIntelligence # Add this
    from src.ai.date_parser import DateParser
    # ...
    ```

3.  **Update Message Generation Logic**

    In the `_check_specific_time` method, after determining availability and conflicts, use the `is_working_hours` utility to check the requested time. If it falls outside working hours, append a note to the response message.

    ```python
    # src/tools/check_availability.py
    
    async def _check_specific_time(
        self,
        credentials: Dict[str, str],
        request: Dict[str, Any],
        user_context: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Check if a specific time is available."""
        start_time = request["datetime"]
        end_time = start_time + timedelta(minutes=request["duration_minutes"])
        # Get conflicts from both systems
        conflicts = await self._get_conflicts(
            credentials, start_time, end_time, user_context
        )
        available = len(conflicts) == 0
    
        # Build the response message
        message = (
            f"You are {'available' if available else 'not available'} "
            f"at {start_time.strftime('%I:%M %p on %A, %B %d')}"
        )
    
        # Add a note if the time is outside working hours
        if not CalendarIntelligence.is_working_hours(start_time):
            message += " (Note: This is outside of typical working hours, 9am-6pm on weekdays)."
    
        return {
            "success": True,
            "available": available,
            "conflicts": conflicts,
            "requested_time": {
                "start": start_time.isoformat(),
                "end": end_time.isoformat(),
                "duration_minutes": request["duration_minutes"]
            },
            "message": message
        }
    ```

#### Verification:

After implementing the changes, run the relevant E2E test to confirm the fix.

```bash
pytest tests/e2e/test_check_availability_e2e.py::TestCheckAvailabilityE2E::test_working_hours_consideration
```

The test should now pass as the response will contain the expected note about working hours.

### Phase 2: Fix "Today" Task Filtering in Calendar Search

**Goal:** The `test_search_todays_items` test fails because it finds no tasks for "today", even though one exists. The root cause is a timezone-related bug where the task's due date (in UTC) is not correctly compared against the user's current date (in their local timezone).

**Relevant Files:**
*   `src/tools/find_and_analyze.py`: To be modified.
*   `tests/e2e/test_find_and_analyze_e2e.py`: To verify the fix.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

1.  **Locate the Time Filtering Logic in `find_and_analyze.py`**

    Open `src/tools/find_and_analyze.py` and navigate to the `_search_reclaim_tasks` method. The issue is within the loop that filters tasks by time range.

2.  **Correct the Date Comparison**

    The current code compares `task_due.date() == now.date()`. However, `task_due` is a UTC datetime, while `now` is a local-timezone datetime. This can lead to incorrect date comparisons around midnight.

    To fix this, we must convert the task's UTC due time to the user's local timezone before extracting and comparing the date part.

    ```python
    # src/tools/find_and_analyze.py
    
    # ... inside _search_reclaim_tasks method ...
            if search_intent.get("time_range"):
                time_range = search_intent["time_range"]
                now = user_context["now"]
                logger.info(f"Applying time filter for range: {time_range}")
                filtered_tasks = []
                for task in task_dicts:
                    if not task.get("due"):
                        continue  # Skip tasks without due dates for time-based searches
                    try:
                        task_due = datetime.fromisoformat(task["due"].replace("Z", "+00:00"))
                        # Ensure both datetimes have timezone info for comparison
                        if task_due.tzinfo is None:
                            task_due = task_due.replace(tzinfo=now.tzinfo)
                        if time_range == "today":
                            # CORRECTED LOGIC: Convert to local timezone before comparing dates
                            task_due_local = task_due.astimezone(now.tzinfo)
                            if task_due_local.date() == now.date():
                                filtered_tasks.append(task)
                        elif time_range == "this_week":
                            week_start = now - timedelta(days=now.weekday())
                            week_start = week_start.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
                            week_end = week_start + timedelta(days=7)
                            if week_start <= task_due < week_end:
                                filtered_tasks.append(task)
                        elif time_range == "overdue":
                            if task_due < now:
                                filtered_tasks.append(task)
                    except Exception as e:
                        logger.warning(f"Failed to parse due date for task {task['id']}: {e}")
                        continue
                task_dicts = filtered_tasks
                logger.info(f"Time filtering reduced tasks to {len(task_dicts)} items")
    # ...
    ```
    The key change is introducing `task_due_local = task_due.astimezone(now.tzinfo)` and using it for the date comparison in the `time_range == "today"` block. The comparisons for `this_week` and `overdue` already use timezone-aware datetime objects and are correct.

#### Verification:

Run the failing E2E test to ensure the task filtering now works correctly.

```bash
pytest tests/e2e/test_find_and_analyze_e2e.py::TestFindAndAnalyzeE2E::test_search_todays_items
```

The test should now pass, with the response including both the test event and the Reclaim task scheduled for today.
