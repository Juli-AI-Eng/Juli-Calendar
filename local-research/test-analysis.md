The user is requesting an analysis of E2E test failures and hanging issues, with a specific focus on time parsing and Flask server stability during testing.

### Analysis of Test Failures and Hanging Issues

**1. Hanging Tests and Flask Server Issues:**

*   **Observation:** The user query mentions hanging issues, and the provided `full_test_results.txt` shows `test_bulk_operation_approval_flow` as `FAILED`, causing pytest to stop immediately (`stopping after 1 failures`). This means the provided logs don't show other potential hangs as the test suite was prematurely terminated.
*   **Flask Debug Mode in E2E:**
    *   `scripts/run_server.py` is used to start the Flask server. When run with `--mode e2e` (as specified in `tests/e2e/conftest.py`), it explicitly sets `debug=True` (`FLASK_DEBUG=1`).
    *   Flask's `debug=True` enables its development server with a reloader. The reloader monitors code changes and restarts the server process automatically. While useful for development, this behavior is highly problematic for automated E2E tests:
        *   **Process Forking:** The reloader typically forks a child process. Interacting with multiple processes from a test runner can lead to unexpected behavior, resource leaks, or orphaned processes.
        *   **Race Conditions:** Automatic restarts can cause race conditions where tests interact with a server that is unexpectedly restarting or in an inconsistent state.
        *   **True Hanging:** If the reloader or its child process gets stuck, it could indeed cause tests to hang indefinitely or lead to ungraceful shutdowns. The `pytest.ini` has a `timeout = 300` (5 minutes), which would eventually kill a truly hung test, but this doesn't prevent intermittent stalls.
*   **Conclusion on Hanging:** The Flask reloader (`debug=True`) is a significant potential cause for test instability, hanging, and unexpected behavior during E2E test runs.

**2. `test_bulk_operation_approval_flow` Failure Analysis:**

*   **Observation:** The `full_test_results.txt` indicates that `test_bulk_operation_approval_flow` failed because "AI Grading Failed".
*   **Specific Failure Point:** The log details show:
    ```
    đŸ“¤ REQUEST:
      Query: "Bulk test task 2"
      Context: "For bulk operation testing"
    đŸ“Ľ RESPONSE:
      Type: task_create_duplicate
      Needs Approval: True
      Message: "A task with a similar title 'Bulk test task 1' already exists. Do you want to create another one?"
    đŸŽŻ EXPECTED:
      Create task number 2 for bulk operation testing
    đŸ¤– AI GRADING VERDICT:
       ❌ FAIL (confidence: 0.0%)
    ```
*   **Root Cause of Failure:** The test expects "Bulk test task 2" to be created directly (without approval), but the system responds by detecting it as a duplicate of "Bulk test task 1" and requires approval (`task_create_duplicate`).
*   **Conflicting Logic:**
    *   `src/ai/calendar_intelligence.py` contains the `titles_are_similar` function. This function has a special rule for "test" or "bulk" tasks with differing numbers: `if nums1 and nums2 and nums1 != nums2: ... if t1_no_nums == t2_no_nums: return False`. This rule explicitly states that "Bulk test task 1" and "Bulk test task 2" should NOT be considered duplicates because their numeric suffixes differ after normalizing the common part.
    *   The test `test_improved_similarity.py` confirms this: `('Bulk test task 1', 'Bulk test task 2')` correctly results in `Duplicate?: False`.
    *   However, the E2E test fails because `manage_productivity.py`'s `_create_reclaim_task` (which calls `_check_duplicate_task`) is incorrectly identifying `Bulk test task 2` as a duplicate. This indicates that the `_check_duplicate_task` function is either not using `CalendarIntelligence.titles_are_similar` correctly or is misinterpreting its result, leading to an approval flow when it shouldn't.

**3. Time Parsing Issue ('this afternoon' returns morning slots):**

*   **Observation:** The user mentions `test_check_availability_e2e.py` and the `intent_router.py` time extraction logic. The specific problem is "this afternoon" returning morning slots.
*   **Relevant Files:**
    *   `src/ai/availability_checker.py`: Contains `analyze_availability_query` which uses OpenAI function calling (`_ai_analysis`) to parse time queries. It also has `_fallback_analysis` but the primary flow should use OpenAI.
    *   `src/ai/date_parser.py`: Provides general date/time parsing utilities, which `availability_checker.py` might implicitly or explicitly use.
*   **Logic Flow:**
    1.  `CheckAvailabilityTool.execute` calls `AvailabilityChecker.analyze_availability_query`.
    2.  `AvailabilityChecker.analyze_availability_query` calls `_ai_analysis`.
    3.  `_ai_analysis` uses OpenAI with `analyze_availability_tool`. The tool's `system_message` dictates how dates and times are parsed and defaults should be applied.
    4.  If the AI correctly extracts `preferences: {prefer_afternoon: true}` or a `datetime` object indicating afternoon, then `_calculate_available_slots` in `check_availability.py` should find afternoon slots.
    5.  If `_ai_analysis` fails, `analyze_availability_query` is supposed to return an error, not fall back to `_fallback_analysis` (which could produce morning defaults).
*   **Hypothesis:** The most probable cause is that the prompt or the model's interpretation within `_ai_analysis` in `src/ai/availability_checker.py` is failing to correctly extract the "afternoon" preference or time component for the "this afternoon" query. This could lead to:
    *   The AI providing a `datetime` that defaults to morning hours (e.g., if it misinterprets "afternoon" as a generic time of day but then uses `current_date` default time, or if it shifts to "tomorrow morning" if it thinks "this afternoon" has passed).
    *   The `preferences` object from the AI not correctly reflecting `prefer_afternoon`, leading `_calculate_available_slots` to return available slots without an afternoon preference, potentially favoring morning ones if they are more abundant or easier to find.

### Recommendations

**1. Address Flask Server Stability (Crucial for E2E Reliability):**

*   **Action:** Disable the Flask reloader/debug mode for E2E tests.
*   **Specific Change (in `scripts/run_server.py`):**
    ```python
    # Original
    # debug = True # for e2e mode
    # Proposed
    # In run_server.py:
    if args.mode == "e2e":
        host = "127.0.0.1"
        port = args.port or 5002
        # Set debug to False for E2E mode for stability
        debug = False 
    else:
        # ... (keep existing logic for prod mode)
    ```
    This change ensures that `flask.Flask.run()` is called with `debug=False` when running in E2E mode, preventing unexpected restarts and improving stability.

**2. Fix Duplicate Task Detection (`test_bulk_operation_approval_flow`):**

*   **Action:** Refine the logic in `_check_duplicate_task` within `src/tools/manage_productivity.py` to ensure it correctly leverages `CalendarIntelligence.titles_are_similar`, specifically its handling of numbered "bulk" tasks.
*   **Specific Area to Inspect/Modify:**
    *   In `src/tools/manage_productivity.py`, within the `_check_duplicate_task` method, confirm that the loop iterating through existing `tasks` correctly passes *both* titles to `CalendarIntelligence.titles_are_similar` and acts on the `False` return value for numbered sequences.
    *   The problematic line would be within the loop:
        ```python
        if CalendarIntelligence.titles_are_similar(task.title, title):
            # This block is incorrectly triggered for "Bulk test task 2"
            return {
                "has_duplicate": True,
                "existing_task": {
                    "id": task.id,
                    "title": task.title,
                    "status": task.status.value if hasattr(task.status, 'value') else str(task.status)
                }
            }
        ```
        The internal logic of `CalendarIntelligence.titles_are_similar` should handle this, so it suggests either `_check_duplicate_task` is ignoring the `False` or there's an unexpected data type conversion.

**3. Refine Time Parsing for "this afternoon" (Availability Tool):**

*   **Action:** Review and potentially refine the `system_message` in `src/ai/availability_checker.py` used by `_ai_analysis` for the `analyze_availability_tool` function call.
*   **Specific Area to Inspect/Modify:**
    *   In `src/ai/availability_checker.py`, examine the `system_message` construction within `_ai_analysis`. Add more explicit instructions or examples for time-of-day phrases:
        ```python
        # In src/ai/availability_checker.py, within _ai_analysis, system_message:
        system_message = f"""You are analyzing availability queries for a calendar system.
        ...
        TIME PARSING:
        - "tomorrow at 2pm" → use tomorrow's date + 14:00:00
        - "Monday morning" → next Monday + 09:00:00
        - "3pm" → today + 15:00:00
        - "this afternoon" → set duration_minutes if specified, and prefer afternoon hours (e.g., 12:00-17:00), setting 'prefer_afternoon': true. DO NOT default to morning times.
        - Always output in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
        ...
        For relative times like "tomorrow at 2pm", calculate from the current datetime.
        For general time ranges like "this afternoon" or "this week", ensure 'preferences' (like prefer_afternoon) are correctly set without overriding specific time slots if mentioned.
        """
    *   Add a dedicated unit test case in `tests/unit/test_check_availability.py` (or a new `test_availability_ai.py`) to precisely test inputs like "find 1 hour this afternoon" and verify the `type`, `datetime` (if applicable), and `preferences` returned by `AvailabilityChecker.analyze_availability_query`.

By implementing these changes, the E2E test suite should become more stable and the identified logical issues resolved.
