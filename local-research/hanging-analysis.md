The E2E tests are reported to be hanging specifically when attempting to create a task like 'Bulk test task 1' via the `manage_productivity` tool. Analysis of the provided repository content and test logs reveals a primary discrepancy and several potential causes for such hanging behavior.

### Analysis of Hanging Issues

1.  **Flask Debug Mode and Auto-Reloader (Primary Suspect for Hanging):**
    *   **User Statement vs. Configuration:** The user states that "the Flask server is running on port 5002 with debug mode disabled." However, inspecting `docker-compose.yml`, the `mcp-server` service, which is relied upon by the `test-runner`, explicitly sets the environment variable `FLASK_DEBUG=1`.
    *   **Problem:** Flask's debug mode, especially with the auto-reloader enabled (which it is by default when `FLASK_DEBUG=1`), is designed for development and continuously monitors code changes to restart the server. In an automated E2E test environment, this behavior is highly problematic:
        *   **Process Forking:** The reloader often runs the application code in a separate child process. This can lead to race conditions, unexpected restarts during tests, and orphaned processes that consume resources.
        *   **Non-Deterministic Behavior:** Automatic restarts make test execution non-deterministic and can cause tests to interact with a server that is in an inconsistent state or mid-restart, leading to hangs or unexpected errors.
    *   **Conclusion:** Running the Flask server with `FLASK_DEBUG=1` (debug mode enabled) is a significant and very common cause of instability and hanging behavior in E2E test suites. This contradicts the user's assertion that debug mode is disabled.

2.  **Asynchronous Operations (`asyncio`) in a Synchronous/Threaded Flask Server:**
    *   **Implementation:** The `server.py` file defines Flask routes as synchronous functions, but inside them, it uses `asyncio.new_event_loop()` and `loop.run_until_complete()` to execute asynchronous methods from the tools (e.g., `tool.execute`).
    *   **Problem:** The `scripts/run_server.py` configures the Flask app to run with `threaded=True`. While this allows multiple requests to be processed concurrently in separate threads, explicitly creating a `new_event_loop()` for *each* request within these threads is an anti-pattern. This can lead to:
        *   `RuntimeError: There is already an event loop in running state`: If the event loop from a previous request isn't properly closed or if `new_event_loop()` is called from a thread where an event loop is already running (e.g., if Flask itself uses an internal event loop or thread pool where loop state persists).
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Continuously creating and tearing down event loops can consume significant resources.
        *   **Deadlocks/Blocking:** Interaction between Python's global interpreter lock (GIL), threading, and event loops can lead to blocking behavior or deadlocks, especially when external I/O (like API calls) is involved.

3.  **`_check_duplicate_task` Method and Performance:**
    *   **Logic:** The `_check_duplicate_task` method (located in `src/tools/manage_productivity.py`) fetches *all* tasks from Reclaim (`Task.list(client)`) and then iterates through them to perform fuzzy string matching using `CalendarIntelligence.titles_are_similar`.
    *   **Potential Bottleneck:** While `difflib.SequenceMatcher` (used by `titles_are_similar`) is generally efficient for individual string comparisons, if the `Task.list(client)` call returns thousands of tasks, iterating through them and performing string comparisons for *every* new task creation request could become a CPU-bound operation that takes a long time. If the client-side test timeout is shorter than this processing time, it might *appear* to hang.
    *   **Contradiction in Logs:** The `full_test_results.txt` for `test_bulk_operation_approval_flow` actually shows that the request for "Bulk test task 2" *did not hang*. Instead, it returned a `needs_approval: true` response with `action_type: task_create_duplicate`. The test failed because the AI grader marked this as incorrect behavior (due to a logical error in duplicate detection for numbered tasks, as outlined in `local-research/test-analysis.md`), causing the entire test suite to stop. This indicates a *logical bug* in the duplicate detection rather than a hang in this specific instance.

### Recommendations to Address Hanging and Stability

1.  **Disable Flask Debug Mode in `docker-compose.yml` for testing:**
    This is the most critical fix for test stability. Update `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    services:
      mcp-server:
        # ... existing config ...
        environment:
          - FLASK_ENV=production # Or testing, but NOT development
          - FLASK_DEBUG=0        # Explicitly disable debug mode
          # ... other environment variables ...
    ```
    This ensures that the Flask auto-reloader, which is detrimental to E2E tests, is not active.

2.  **Improve Asyncio Integration in Flask:**
    Even with debug mode off, creating a new event loop for every request in a threaded Flask app is not ideal and can cause subtle issues or performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Immediate workaround (if `debug=False` isn't enough):** Consider using a library like `flask-executor` or `threading.Thread` to offload blocking I/O (like `loop.run_until_complete`) from the main Flask request thread, or re-architect to use an async Flask setup with `gunicorn` and an ASGI server like `uvicorn` (e.g., `gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker src.server:app`).
    *   For the current setup, ensuring `debug=False` is the primary fix.

3.  **Optimize Duplicate Task Detection (Performance):**
    If disabling Flask debug mode doesn't fully resolve *all* perceived hangs, or if task creation becomes slow with many tasks:
    *   **Client-side filtering:** If the Reclaim.ai API supports filtering or searching tasks by title (or a fuzzy match) directly via the API, implement that. The current implementation fetches *all* tasks, which scales poorly.
    *   **Caching:** For the `Task.list(client)` call, consider caching the list of tasks for a short period if the list doesn't change frequently between requests, reducing redundant API calls.

4.  **Fix Logical Error in Duplicate Task Detection (for `test_bulk_operation_approval_flow`):**
    While not a "hang," this is a test failure that needs addressing. The `local-research/test-analysis.md` correctly identifies that `CalendarIntelligence.titles_are_similar` should return `False` for numbered tasks like "Bulk test task 1" and "Bulk test task 2". The fact that the test fails due to duplicate detection means either:
    *   The `titles_are_similar` function is not behaving as expected in the actual runtime environment (e.g., regex issues, subtle string differences).
    *   There's an interaction where another task with a genuinely similar name is already present and being detected.
    Re-verify the behavior of `CalendarIntelligence.titles_are_similar` directly in the E2E environment with actual task titles from the test run, or use a more robust duplicate check that is less prone to fuzzy matching misinterpretations for numbered sequences.

By addressing the Flask debug mode and refining the async execution pattern, the core "hanging" issues should be mitigated, leading to a more stable E2E test environment. The logical issue with duplicate task detection is separate but also requires attention for test correctness.
